- 👋 Hi, I’m @tobz619
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages and building software. Ideally I would like to end up using Haskell for machine learning as well as building video games and engines for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell with an eye to learning Rust next. My current job teaches me C/C++, Java and Python. It is a tech consultancy that designs embedded software both large and small for a variety of customers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me improve my Haskell and use it to solve more problems -> ultimately I want to make more games.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: toloke@yahoo.co.uk; twitter [@tobz619](https://twitter.com/tobz619)!
