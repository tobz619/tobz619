- 👋 Hi, I’m @tobz619
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages and building software. Ideally I would like to end up using Haskell for machine learning as well as building video games and engines for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell with an eye to learning Rust next. My next job will teach me C++ and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me improve my Haskell and use it to solve more problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: toloke@yahoo.co.uk; twitter @tobz619!
